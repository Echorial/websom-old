* \brief This is the template class for all 'Widgets'.
*
*
* Widgets are used everywhere in websom. Typically these are used in modules, for allowing other programmers to easily call upon your widget and receive some sort of html structured
* item. A good example of a widget could be, if you have a Module that manages Forums, and you want to implement this Forum tool into a page on your website. To do so you would create
* a new Forum_Viewer widget and call Get_Widget($myForumViewer), then echo that onto your page.
*
* To create custom widgets you would simply extend the Widget class and override the needed methods.
